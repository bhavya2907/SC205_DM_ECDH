# SC205_DM_ECDH

This code is an implementation of Elliptic curve Diffie Hellman key exchange algorithm. The curve parameters such as 'a' , 'b' , and field 'p' is set by user and certain operations such as:
1)Finding all integer points on the curve.
2)Adding two points.
3)Multiplying a point.
4)Implementation of Diffie Hellman key exchange between two parties.
